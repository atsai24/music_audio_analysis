 ## Introduction
In this analysis, I inspect various features of songs extracted from audio, and attempt to find the differences of music based on genre. Using these features, I build a classification model to determine the genre of a song.

 ## Data
The data was taken from the [Free Music Archive](https://github.com/mdeff/fma), a dataset collected by [MichaÃ«l Defferrard](https://deff.ch),
[Kirell Benzi](https://kirellbenzi.com),
[Pierre Vandergheynst](https://people.epfl.ch/pierre.vandergheynst),
[Xavier Bresson](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/xbresson).  for the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), 2017.
The dataset contains: 

 - Track Metadata: Information on each track including genre (target variable), listen count, composer, creation date.
 
 - Spotify Features: Song features extracted from Spotify API including tempo, danceability, acousticness.
 
 - Audio Features: Features extracted from the audio itself, including MFCC and spectral contrast
 
 - Audio: The audio files themselves in waveform

## Exploration
Examining the Audio data:
 - Waveform

Examining Spotify Audio Features:
There are 8 audio features provided by spotify for each track:
 - Acousticness: Confidence measure between 0.0 and 1.0 of whether a song is acoustic
